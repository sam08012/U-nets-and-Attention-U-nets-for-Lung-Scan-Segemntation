# U-nets-and-Attention-U-nets-for-Lung-Scan-Segemntation
## Comparative Analysis of U-nets and Attention U-nets for Lung Scan Segmentation

### Project Overview:
This ongoing project focuses the segmentation of lung CT scans, its application is to aid doctors in identifying lung lobes and tumors accurately. Utilizing supervised learning techniques, the project leverages neural networks to extract segments from CT scan images.

### Objective:
The primary goal is to compare the performance of two architectures: U-nets and Attention U-nets, in lung scan segmentation. We aim to determine which architecture yields superior results in terms of accuracy, and efficiency.

### Current Status:
The project is in progress, with ongoing efforts on fine-tuning the architectures and optimizing the code.

### Future Steps:
- Continual refinement and optimization of U-nets and Attention U-nets architectures.
- Extensive experimentation and evaluation of different hyperparameters and training strategies.
- Collaboration with medical professionals to validate the effectiveness and clinical applicability of the segmentation results.

Stay tuned for updates as we strive to advance the state-of-the-art in lung scan segmentation for improved medical diagnosis and treatment planning.
