# U-nets-and-Attention-U-nets-for-Lung-Scan-Segemntation
In progress comparative analysis for results obtained by Unets and Attention-Unets for Lung scan segmentaion
This project aims at improving the segmenatation of CT scans performed on lungs. It is a supervised based technique that uses conceot of neural network for extraction of segments. These segments are utilized by doctors to pin-point lobes or tumors inside lungs.

Results are still being improved with fine tuning of this archieetcture.

## Comparative Analysis of U-nets and Attention U-nets for Lung Scan Segmentation

### Project Overview:
This ongoing project focuses the segmentation of lung CT scans, its application is to aid doctors in identifying lung lobes and tumors accurately. Utilizing supervised learning techniques, the project leverages neural networks to extract segments from CT scan images.

### Objective:
The primary goal is to compare the performance of two architectures: U-nets and Attention U-nets, in lung scan segmentation. We aim to determine which architecture yields superior results in terms of accuracy, and efficiency.

- **Attention U-nets Notebook:** [View Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/196mub47JMsQodxb_y-dfGH0eVoSKZp-P?usp=sharing)

### Current Status:
The project is in progress, with ongoing efforts on fine-tuning the architectures and optimizing the code.

### Future Steps:
- Continual refinement and optimization of U-nets and Attention U-nets architectures.
- Extensive experimentation and evaluation of different hyperparameters and training strategies.
- Collaboration with medical professionals to validate the effectiveness and clinical applicability of the segmentation results.

Stay tuned for updates as we strive to advance the state-of-the-art in lung scan segmentation for improved medical diagnosis and treatment planning.
